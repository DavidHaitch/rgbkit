# RGB Kit

RGB Kit is a hardware SDK that is able to control devices from multiple RGB ecosystems. It utilizes a few basic concepts to keep the SDK simple and easy to understand and use. It is written in C# and uses .NET Standard 2.1.

It was designed with dependency injection in mind and works very well with .NET Core 3.0 worker services as well as ASP.NET Core 3.0 web apps/services.

It also has the potential to be used in games written in C# or have access to the CLR/.NET Standard 2.1. Do note however that Windows is the only supported platform.

For info on how to use this refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/rgbkit/rgbkit/wiki)
